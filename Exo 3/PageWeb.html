  Just say <strong>NO</strong> <br>
      to deforestation!<br>
     Palm oil, found in half of all processed foods in the US,<br>
     and many common household products is a key contributor to rainforest deforestation!<br>
     Read your food and product labels carefully <br>
      and refuse to buy products with palm oil or insist on sustainable alternatives.

      <strong><i>Fundraise for us!</i></strong><br>

  Music isn’t just universal — it’s a huge part of our heritage. <br>
  From concerts in large venues like those Sting used to finance the Rainforest Foundation at its inception,<br>
  to smaller concerts at your local coffee shop or bar music is a great opportunity to strengthen your community while helping protect the rainforests!<br>
  While many of our fundraisers have been musical events, they don’t have to be–your imagination is the only limit! Rainforest defenders have sold lemonade,<br>
  held poetry slams, organized talks on the rainforest and run marathons. Contact us with your idea!
