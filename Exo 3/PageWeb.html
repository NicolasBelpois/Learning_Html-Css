      <h3>Just say NO
      to deforestation!</h3>
      Palm oil, found in half of all processed foods in the US,
      and many common household products is a key contributor to rainforest deforestation!
      Read your food and product labels carefully
      and refuse to buy products with palm oil or insist on sustainable alternatives.

      <h3>Fundraise for us!</h3>

      Music isn’t just universal — it’s a huge part of our heritage.
      From concerts in large venues like those Sting used to finance the Rainforest Foundation at its inception,
      to smaller concerts at your local coffee shop or bar music is a great opportunity to strengthen your community while helping protect the rainforests!
      While many of our fundraisers have been musical events, they don’t have to be–your imagination is the only limit! Rainforest defenders have sold lemonade,
      held poetry slams, organized talks on the rainforest and run marathons. Contact us with your idea!

     <h3>Use BitSeeds!</h3><br>

BitSeeds are radically new way to fund rainforest protection. BitSeeds are a digital currency like Bitcoin with one important difference: every BitSeed that you make, save or spend helps the Rainforest Foundation! By making or “mining”, purchasing, or spending BitSeeds you help us fund programs that protect the rainforest around the world. We guarantee that this is the only time we will ever encourage mining–the mining of BitSeeds that is

<h3>Create a Habitat
for migrating animals!</h3><br>

Whether you have a backyard, balcony or window sill, you can help migrating birds on their way home. It’s easy and fun! Just  plant native plants, bird and insect attracting flowers, or even just hang up a bird bath or bird house.  All of these help migrating birds make it to the rainforests of Central and South America.  By giving them food water and shelter or even just giving the insects they eat a little room to thrive you help the amazing migrations that our winged friends make every year.

        Make sure the next generation of Rainforest Defenders has something to protect! Our Rainforests are disappearing at an alarming rate but there is a solution that works. Make sure those who have always protected our forests can continue to do so. Indigenous communities have a long track record of successfully protecting the rainforest. Satellite images and drone footage now prove it is true the best protected rainforests aren’t part national parks, private land or owned by the state, they are lands owned collectively by indigenous communities.
